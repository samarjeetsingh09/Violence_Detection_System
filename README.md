# Violence_Detection_System
A real-time violence detection system designed to monitor CCTV footage using deep learning techniques. The system leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models to accurately identify violent activities and immediately alert concerned authorities.
# Features
Real-time detection of violent events from live CCTV feeds.
CNN + LSTM model trained on annotated datasets with 85%+ accuracy.
Instant alert system to notify authorities within 2 seconds of detection.
Optimized for low false positives and fast inference on edge devices (Raspberry Pi/NVIDIA Jetson etc.).

# Tech Stack
Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras
CNN, LSTM
Real-time video streaming
Alert system (Email/SMS/Webhook integration)

# Use Cases
Public surveillance in transportation hubs, schools, malls
Security systems in sensitive or high-risk areas
Automated monitoring in smart cities
